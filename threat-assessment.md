title: "Workshop 2: Threat Assessment"
---

## Setup in Advance
1. Ensure there is a project for each participant to discuss. Each project should have at least 3 participants who know it well enough to discuss possible security problems.For participants with no such shared projects (or who have reasons not to discuss them), use the ‘MoneyZoom’ project from the previous Agile App Security Game workshop, and ensure each such participant has a printed description available (such as from the previous workshop).

### Setup in Advance – Face-to-face
1. Arrange tables for participants so each table has 3-6 participants, all familiar with one project.
2. Place a large number of various coloured post-it notes and appropriate (sharpie- style) pens on each table.
3. Set up whiteboards and flip charts (one for each project to be discussed the participants and one extra).
4. Have a few (whiteboard/flipchart) marker pens in two contrasting (allowing for colour blindness) colours. E.g. Black and red, or blue and red.
5. Locate a timing device (eg. mobile phone, physical timer, or Google Search “countdown timer”).

## Running the Workshop

The timings are approximate. 
Adjust them according to how the teams are getting on in each step.

### Step 1: Ideation (30 min)
Display the slide with: *Who might do what bad thing to whom?
    Person – Thing – Reason*

Ask the groups to think about their project, and ‘ideate’ answers, writing down the person-thing-reason combinations on the post-its on their board.
Encourage everyone to write independently (duplicates will be combined in the next step).
Remind them that not every bad thing is malicious; sometimes security or privacy issues happen due to accident or misunderstandings.
Encourage them to discuss the issues, and to gather as many completed post-its (‘threats’) as they reasonably can.

### Step 2: Organisation (15 min)
Have the participants in each room cluster the ‘post-its’ into ‘topics’, posting related ones close together and duplicates on top of each other.

### Step 3: Evaluation (15 min)
This step identifies the most important threats.
Copy the ‘dot voting sets’ to the appropriate boards for each breakout room.
Ask each participant to pick the threats (post-its) that are (a) most likely, and (b) most damaging.
And to place a black dot next to the each of the three they consider most likely; and a red dot next to the three they think most damaging.
When they’re done, take a photo of each of the resulting boards, for reference.

### Step 4: Summary (10 min)

Get the Technical Leads or a responsible couple of people from each project to use the dots next to each post-it to position a selection of the threats on the grid.
A dozen or so is a good number to aim for.
Figure 4 shows an example (online); Figure 5, an example face-to-face.
The threats towards the top right are the most important ones to consider in the corresponding projects.

### Notes
The risk-impact grid is an inaccurate way to assess risks; however it is easy to understand and use.
More sophisticated teams may well use better approaches, but these are outside the scope of this workshop.
