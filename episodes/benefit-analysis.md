## Introduction

By this point, your group should have a risk-impact grid populated with the threats that your group came up with.


**Single group workshops**: Now you are going to choose 2-3 threats that you want to discuss.

**Multi-group workshops**: Now you are going to choose one threat that you want to discuss.

Your new mission is to make a case to Product Management to address the threat, using the board to explain your conclusions.
This requires two things:

- A way to address the threat (a ‘mitigation’, in security jargon), ideally with an
idea of the effort required, or a means to discover what effort is required.
This only needs to be sketchy.
- The **positive** benefit to the organisation of addressing the threat. This often
requires some ingenuity.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion 

**Multi-group workshops**: Select one person to present your findings to all of the groups.
