title: "Workshop 3: Benefit Analysis"
---

This workshop requires:

1. The results of the previous workshop (boards)
2. Face-to-face: Flipchart paper at each table, or other means for participants to create a small poster.

## Setup in Advance - Face-to-Face

1. From the matrix of threats created in Workshop 2, select the most important 3-5 to discuss.
There should be at least three participants to discuss each one; if participant numbers are limited, use a smaller number and have each participant discuss more than one (which will take longer).
2. Put the corresponding post-its widely separated on the walls of the room (perhaps one on each wall).

## Running the Workshop

The timings are approximate. Adjust them according to how the teams are getting on in each step.

### Step 1: Selection (5 min)

**Face-to-face:** Have the participants form groups next to the post-its according to their
preferences for the threats they each would like to discuss, arranging themselves so that
appropriate numbers are next to each one.

### Step 2: Mitigation and Positive Benefit (30 minutes)

Tell the participants that the mission for each group, then, is to make a case for product management to address the threat. 
This requires two things:
- A way to address the threat (a ‘mitigation’, in security jargon), ideally with an idea of the effort required, or a means to discover what effort is required. 
This only needs to be sketchy.
- The positive benefit to the organisation of addressing the threat. This often requires some ingenuity.

Ask the participants use the board to explain their conclusions.

### Step 3: Presentation (5 minutes per group)

Ask each group to select a presenter, and have each present the selected board to all the groups together.
Record the board contents and notes of the presentations for reference later.

### Note – Small Numbers

If working with a small number of participants sufficient only for one group, have them repeat steps 1 – 2 for two or three different threats, with no presentation step.
They can create multiple presentations on one board.

### Step 4: Checklist Discussion

Show the checklist slide and briefly describe each of these.

Return the participants to the same breakout groups to discuss:
- Which of these should be considered?
- How might they manage further learning?

### Step 5: Next steps
Ask the breakout groups to identify SMART objectives to take forward.

**SMART:**
- **S:** Specific
- **M:** Measurable
- **A:** Achievable
- **R:** Realistic
- **T:** Timely
