:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do you communicate about threats?
- How do you justify which threats to address?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- By completing this activity, you should be more knowledgeable on how to communicate with managerment/decision makers about threats.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

By this point, your group should have a risk-impact grid populated with the threats that your group came up with.


**Single group workshops**: Now you are going to choose 2-3 threats that you want to discuss.

**Multi-group workshops**: Now you are going to choose one threat that you want to discuss.

Your new mission is to make a case to Product Management to address the threat, using the board to explain your conclusions.
This requires two things:

- A way to address the threat (a ‘mitigation’, in security jargon), ideally with an
idea of the effort required, or a means to discover what effort is required.
This only needs to be sketchy.
- The **positive** benefit to the organisation of addressing the threat. This often
requires some ingenuity.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion 

**Multi-group workshops**: Select one person to present your findings to all of the groups.

At the end of the survey, it will ask you to write a letter to your future self on what kind of changes you plan to make to your work processes in response to this workshop.
When writing this letter, consider writing SMART objectives.
